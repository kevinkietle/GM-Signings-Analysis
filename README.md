# GM Signings Analysis
Graded NBA GMs on the value they acquired in offseason free agency signings between the years 2022-2024.

Executive Summary:

This analysis evaluates NBA offseason signings from 2022-2024, focusing on each GM's efficiency in acquiring win shares. The dataset, combining manually collected offseason transactions with first-year win share data from Basketball Reference, enabled the calculation of a cost-per-win-share metric. Results indicate that certain GMs, especially from struggling teams, had higher costs per win share, while some high-performing teams also showed inefficiency, likely due to talent acquisition via drafts or trades. The report further analyzes each GM's decision-making by comparing the cost-efficiency of acquired versus departing players, providing insights on which GMs have been successful at allowing players to walk in addition to just acquiring talent.\
